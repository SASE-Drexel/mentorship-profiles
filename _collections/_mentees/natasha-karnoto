### About

I am an open minded type of gal, who's not afraid to try new things. I can be talkative or silently reflective there's no in between. Sometimes I can be the type of person who tells a story with many side stories before I get to the point. 

### Career Goals

My overarching dream is to become a creative technologist at a high tech company and work with human-computer interaction. Hopefully, I find a way to combine my artistic and scientific side of my brain.

### Looking For

I love to paint portraits and have been trying to become more involved with digital art more. Sometimes I have too much of the jitters so I let it out by either lifting, hiking, or rapping complicated lyrics.
