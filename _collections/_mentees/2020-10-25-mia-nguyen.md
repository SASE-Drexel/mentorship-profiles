### About

I am a 5â€™7 asian girl with long dark hair and no glasses. I have very long noticeable nails. I am blunt so if anything comes as sarcastic, I donâ€™t mean to sound so aggressive ðŸ¤§. I do get shy but once I get to know you, Iâ€™m pretty open. My zodiac sign is a cancer. I can also be very forgetful so a mentor would be amazing. 

### Career Goals

Being rich wouldnâ€™t be the worst but, if I were to be financially stable, Iâ€™d be pleased as well. 

### Interests

I love art, specifically painting, drawing and calligraphy. I listen to music 25/8! Preferably R&B but I can listen to anything. I watch a lot of reality TV which is so badðŸ¤§ but I canâ€™t live without it. Guilty pleasure is definitely Starbucks and Chipotle. I canâ€™t live without it. 

### Looking For

Someone to guide me through this semester because I can be easily lost and frustrated. I would love to be good friends as well. Being inside all the time can be exhausting.
