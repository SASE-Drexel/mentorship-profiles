### About

I am a new sophomore who would like to participate in clubs more despite the current conditions. Generally I'd describe myself as on the reserved side, but I like talking with someone and getting to know what kind of person they are and what things interest them. 

### Career Goals

Currently my only long term goal is to possibly go into law school an go into law. However currently I want to explore the other career options that Economics can possibly lead me to. Additionally I'm planning on minoring in computer science so I might also pursue that area as well.

### Interests

I am into basketball and follow the nba pretty hard. Generally though I'd say I'm more into geeky things like videogames, and anime. I also like drawing and EDM type music.

### Looking For

On the academic/career side I am looking for someone who can assist me in choosing the best classes to take, and help me discover the career path I should focus on. Largely though I'm looking for a friend and having the opportunity to socialize more during this situation.
