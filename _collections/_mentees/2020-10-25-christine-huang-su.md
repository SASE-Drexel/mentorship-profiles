### About

I am a Freshmen majoring in International Business. I know how to speak two dialects of Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese) and I hope to continue learning Spanish and start learning Korean. I also know how to read Chinese and write some Chinese. I am kind of confused with everything available or happening in college so I hope to have a mentor to guide me or give me advice when they are free.

### Career Goals

I want to major in International Business and possibly double majoring in Finance too. I wish to work at a company where I would be able to travel to other countries for business reasons and utilize the knowledge and skills I gained from Drexel. I also hope to be accepted into a Master’s program for a Master’s degree to benefit me more in the job market in the future. 

### Interests

My favorite subject is math, though I’m not always the best at it. I also enjoy learning new languages and trying new food and music. 

### Looking For

I’m looking for someone who would be willing to guide me in these years of college and give me advice on what I could do next. I wish to learn more information about what college is like, what classes to take, and how to apply for co-op, and how to balance my time. I also just hope to meet more people and make new friends to go get boba and food :)
