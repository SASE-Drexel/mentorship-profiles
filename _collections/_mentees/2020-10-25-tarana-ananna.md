### About

Hi, I'm Tarana. I'm currently in the 5 year 3 co-op program at Drexel. I'm shy, a little quiet, but friendly! Workwise, I like keeping myself organized and on track. I am passionate about constantly improving myself and learning new things that help me personally and academically.

### Career Goals

I want to explore the different career routes as an Accountant, experience 3 co-ops and determine if I like public or private accounting firms. I also want to learn communication skills and network with others.

### Interests

I like playing tennis, listening to music(mostly pop), hanging out with friends, eating spicy food, and doing embroidery.

### Looking For

I want a genuine friend who I can look up to and who can guide(or scold) me as I make academic, professional, or personal decisions throughout my college years.
