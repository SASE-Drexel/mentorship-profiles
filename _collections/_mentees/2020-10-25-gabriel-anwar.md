### About

I am a very outgoing Indonesian-American who is also very laid back at the same time. I like to learn new things and create things as I progress. 

### Career Goals

In an Ideal world, I would love to be a sailor or captain a charter ship. However, for a more conventional career, I would really like to be a marine engineer for a naval defense contractor

### Interests

I love music and nature. I love keeping my hands full by picking up new hobbies and exploring my surroundings. 

### Looking For

I'm looking for someone I can connect with on as many levels as possible from professional to personal
