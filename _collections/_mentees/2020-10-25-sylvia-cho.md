### About

Hey, I'm Sylvia and I am a currently a freshman. I would describe myself as an ambivert and I love interacting with new people even if I can be awkward sometimes. I do think my passion for my work can be intense, so I look forward to finding an outlet through SASE where I can branch out and connect with other people in the SASE community. I definitely need to work on finding a balance between academics and my social life. 

### Career Goals

At the moment, I am aiming for a career as a prosthetic or human performance engineer, although I have been considering going down a pre-med track. If not, I hope to maybe dabble into stem cell research and regenerative medicine. However, all of this is still up for debate. 

### Interests

I'm obviously interested in BME, but this also extends to prosthetics, medicine, research, and so on. Even as a STEM major, I do like art and English. Aside from this, over quarantine I've started to cook more which I really enjoy--and I would be down to cook with other people! I do also like to listen to a variety of music, from 1D to r&b/soul (like Giveon, RINI, Brent Faiyaz, etc.), and even rock.

### Looking For

I honestly do not have a preference and I am ok with having a mentor that falls into any of these categories. It would be nice to establish a personal relationship, but I think this would, in a sense, come with professional and academic ties as well.
