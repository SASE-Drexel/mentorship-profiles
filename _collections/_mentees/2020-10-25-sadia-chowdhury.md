### About

I'm quite awkward and introverted, but i can be funky and energetic if I'm comfortable enough. I guess I'm someone to get used to. I like odd things that juxtapose, and i laugh at dumb things, but i guess I try to live my best life? IDK SKSJS 

### Career Goals

Out of the many things I'm unsure of, i think this one of the bigger ones. I don't have anything concrete in mind, just the basic level "i want to help people through Engineering." I like the idea of the unexpected, rather than something consistent. Problem-solving with a team is great because every person has their own strength, and therefore every person contributes differently. 

### Interests

I love nature. I wouldn't say I'm fit, no where near, but i love hiking! Taking in the smells, sounds, the sight, it's all a sobering feeling. I also like learning languages. I'm thinking of minoring in French. I really like dinosaurs and ducks, just animals in general. And i really like alt rock and korean artists (my favorite groups are Stray Kids and HYUKOH!).

### Looking For

I guess just an acquaintance (friend, perhaps?) That is reassuring, who i can just talk to about my everyday school concerns, or work, or anything. Someone who is comfortable, and also isn't weirded out easily cause my brain is a little on the wild side.
