### About

I am someone who loves food and milktea. I am usually not comfortable with people I barely know so this is why I want to be a mentee.

### Career Goals

I have no idea what I want to do so I'm going to take different coops. I would most likely become an accountant.

### Interests

I love to watch true crime told by Stephanie Soo, building 1000 piece puzzles, thrifting, diy and repurpose things I no longer use. Mostly I spend a lot of free time on YouTube watching either random videos or listening to Chinese songs. 

### Looking For

Someone who is majoring or minor in business or have some similar interest as me. Also, it would be best if they could talk for hours about random things since I do want the mentor and mentee experience to make me more comfortable with people that I normally don't talk to.
