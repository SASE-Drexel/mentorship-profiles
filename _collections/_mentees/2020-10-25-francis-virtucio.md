### About

I’m an energetic and outgoing guy that likes to meet people and connect with them in any way I can! I can be pretty nerdy, but I feel like it adds to my goofy nature.

### Career Goals

Career-wise I aim to be come a doctor. My highest-achieving dream would be becoming a neurosurgeon, but that’s definitely tough. Ultimately I want to bring joy to peoples lives with my talents; in terms of vision, I want to be a doctor that treats their patients as more than just “subjects”.

### Interests

I love music; I’ve played a couple instruments in the past, but my main focus now is guitar. I also love playing tennis and squash, and will almost always find time to play with someone if they ask. This past year I developed a strong interest in dance, and during quarantine developed a new interest in online gaming. In all though, I love any activity where I can meet people and interact with them.

### Looking For

I’m mainly looking for a mentor that can guide me in my academic pursuits while at Drexel, but not be too overwhelming about it. Just someone that I can feel comfortable sharing my achievements and failures with, and also be just as much of a friend and homie as they are a mentor.
