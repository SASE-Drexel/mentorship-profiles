### About

I’m a people person. I love meeting new people and learning about their backgrounds, which makes me conversational. I’m also very energetic and I’m not afraid to be myself around others. I would also describe myself to be hard working as I strive to do my best in achieving goals I set for myself and I try to help others achieve theirs as well.  

### Career Goals

My short-term career goals include being able to intern or volunteer at a doctor’s office, hospital, or any place in the medical field in order to gain more experience. In the end, I hope to become a physician assistant. I’d like to work in a hospital and be exposed to a variety of areas in medicine in order to see what field I would specialize in.  

### Interests

My main interests include dancing, listening to music, and exploring different restaurants in the city! I listen to all types of music, specifically artists such as keshi, Giveon, BTS, and more. I’m also obsessed with the shows Avatar and Black Mirror, going out to get kbbq/boba, playing among us (but who isn’t haha), and traveling/exploring new places.  

### Looking For

I’m looking for a mentor who I can easily be comfortable with and be myself around. Not only would I like to look up to them as someone who can guide and help me with advice/connections, but I’d also like to look to them as a friend/sibling that I have a close bond with.
