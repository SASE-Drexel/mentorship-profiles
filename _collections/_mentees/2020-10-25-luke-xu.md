### About
Hey! I am an outgoing person who wants to have fun but also knows when business needs to be done. I love to create and invent things, be it food or a 3D Printed gadget. Something people know me as is, "Janky". I earned this title from robotics in high school because I would always have these questionable ideas and ways of doing things that somehow works.

### Career Goals

In the future, I want to design something and make a business out of it. This would combine my engineering mindset as well as my business mindset. I don't really want to "work a 9-5" but I am accepting of the fact that I will most likely do it for a bit of time.

### Interests

I like to spend my time making videos and playing games. I also like designing things on CAD software and printing it. I think wireless transmittance (infrared, Bluetooth, WiFi) and how it works is pretty interesting...?

### Looking For

I look for someone with experience in business (Maybe someone with a startup :DD) who is also willing to spend time to teach me the intricacies of the career I want to go into. I also would like them to be able to tutor me on certain classes that I have a hard time in.
