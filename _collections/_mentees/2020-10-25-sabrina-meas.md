### About

I enjoy meeting new people and open up to them easily, which makes me easy to talk to. I am a pretty curious person who is enthusiastic about many things, making me a good communicator as well. I also find myself helping others a lot, listening to their problems and giving them advice.

### Career Goals

I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do. I know that I want to do something with biotechnology, where I can work with medical and pharmaceutical facilities. I want to work close to scientific/medical research.

### Interests

I really like to video edit, although I'm still quite an amateur at it. I'm into Lo-fi and Indie music, and I am obsessed with K-dramas (Also, Grey's Anatomy and Black Mirror). I also love cafe hopping, eating (but who doesn't), and doing mini photoshoots with my friends!

### Looking For

I want a mentor who I can be personal with, like a friend I can be close with, but also someone who can be very helpful in guiding me and giving me advice. A mentor who is like an older sibling/friend, who can push me out of my comfort zone and help me build connections.
