### Career Goals

My career goal as of right now is to learn more about engineering and to see what opportunities are out there for me. In the future, I want to find the type of engineer I want to be and pursue that.

### Interests

I really enjoy playing and watching basketball. I am also into men's fashion.

### Looking For

I am looking for a mentor that can help guide me through college and give me insight about jobs and stuff like that. Also, I am looking for someone that I can just hangout with.
