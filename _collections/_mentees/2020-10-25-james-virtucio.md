### About

I'm a Filipino BME Major in the BS/MS Program from Vineland, NJ. I try to be a pretty friendly and social person, but with regards to college life, school definitely comes first for me. Even though we're virtual, I'm hoping to make the most out of my freshman year.

### Career Goals

I hope to someday become a researcher in Biomedical Devices. I'm not sure which types of devices yet, but lately, I've found the idea of syncing up robotics with the human body to be really cool. Moving forward, I hope to find which area of BME is right for me.

### Interests

Academically, I've found scientific topics like experiments to be interesting to me. Outside of school, though, I like to build robots, play music and write songs, cook, play sports like tennis, practice martial arts, and a bit of video games, too. Also, I'd be down to try new activities, too.

### Looking For

Someone who can guide me as I try to shape myself as a BME student, but also someone to be a friend, too. I still want to be able to talk to them about things outside of Drexel, so someone who's open to both helping me out and nice to talk to might be good for me.
