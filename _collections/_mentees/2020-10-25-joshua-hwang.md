### About

I'm social and click with people easily, and love to get involved in things that i'm passionate about. I'm self motivated and do my best to give 110% in the things I choose to do. I love music and am into thrifting/fashion and it would be great to know someone who also loves thrifting and hit up spots in philly! My favorite past time is going out with friends and taking day trips around California. Although I love to go out I also am very organize.d and keep on top of school work by studying in groups(or discord for now)

### Career Goals

For directly after college, I am hoping to get an engineering job through my 3 coops. I am still very unsure of what exact engineering field I want to go into and i believe that my time in classes and help from a mentor will help me realize what my calling is. As for now, the only thing I know for sure is that I do want to work in some kind of engineering field and maybe a mix with some managerial roles as well.

### Interests

In my freetime, I love to trail run / road run and going into the outdoors(camping, hiking,etc). My music taste is mixed but focuses more on rap, R&B, trap, and bed pop. Artists like Joji, Lil Uzi, Adele, Saba, Frank Ocean, Giveon, and SZA make up most of my playlists. I'm also really into fashion and am going to thrift around philly when I get there. 

### Looking For

As said before, I am looking for someone who would be a close friend and at the same time someone who could help me academically and professional through coop as well.
