### About

I'm from Mumbai, India. I'm passionate about tech that impacts people in positive ways. I run the Women in Computing Society club at Drexel.

### Previous Work Experience
- Software Engineer, Microsft
- Quant Analyst, Goldman Sachs
- Software Engineering & PM, Microsoft
- Data Scientist, Wego
- Smart Grid Engineer, PECO

### Career Goals

My goal is to be a software engineer working on an ethical product that improves peoples. 

### Interests

I do a lot of D&I work, I'm the President of Women in Computing Society. I also like cooking, watching random movies, building apps and never finishing them. I try to be a minimalist. 

### What to expect from me

I envision a relationship that best works for the mentee. We can set up regular meetings or we can only meet when they have questions. If they need me to do mock interviews or use me for accountability, I can do that. Most importantly, I would advise them to use me as a resource for whatever it is they need.
