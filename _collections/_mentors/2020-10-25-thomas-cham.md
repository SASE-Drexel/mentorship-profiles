### About

My name is Thomas. I'm a comp sci major, so you'll typically find me talking about programming with friends. I'm very easy to talk to so don't be scared to approach. 

### Previous Work Experience
- Technical Support Manager @ CCI
- Software Developer @ Sharing Excess

### Career Goals

My main career goal is to find a job that I find comfortable and happy doing. Hopefully no more 9 am's :P

### Interests

 I like anime, photography, finding new foods/restaurants, and video games. Favorite anime is Zetsuen no Tempest. Favorite photography spot in Philly is the Schuylkill river trail. Favorite video games right now are CS:GO and Valorant. 

### What to expect from me

I hope I won't just be seen as a mentor mostly. I hope to make a new friend as well. My mentee should be able to feel like he/she can come to me for anything.
