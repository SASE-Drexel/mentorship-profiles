### About

I am a Vietnamese-American student who dedicates himself to his work, whether its academically with grades, culturally with clubs and performances, or socially with helping others. I even having trouble saying "no" at times. However, I still allocate time to myself to have fun and express my quirky self.

### Career Goals

I would like to have a career that allows me to help others and/or express my creativity, such as in cybersecurity or game development. I would also like the freedom to be able to travel around the world and explore other cultures.

### Interests

I love going out with friends, whether it's something active like soccer, dancing, or hiking, or something more casual like club events or getting bubble tea. When I'm not out, I enjoy video games, playing music, and watching anime.

### What to expect from me

I envision my relationship with my mentee to be one that lasts our time at Drexel, and even past that if possible. I plan to guide my mentee and build a mutual trust between us so that we can talk to and depend on each other, whatever the topic.
