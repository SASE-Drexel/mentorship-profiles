### About

Even though I’m basically 20 years old, I still act like a kid. I love meeting new people and can pretty chill. I do like to stay in and just watch anime for a couple of hours with a box of frosted flakes too. I love to learn, whether it’s a game or how to tie a shoe, I’ll definitely be interested. 

### Previous Work Experience
- Terumo Medical Corporation

### Career Goals

Still in the air with a couple of things, but I do want to work for a bigger known corporation, maybe in medical devices. I can’t say that I have a specific career goal in mind, but I hope to be able to work as hard as possible to be in a place and be proud of how far I’ve come.

### Interests

I love to bullet journal and play tetris. I’m also interested in anime and drawing. I’m interested in making memories with my friends and exploring new places, whether it’s a new or old location. Boba is definitely a favorite, even though my favorite flavor is milk tea. I like j-pop and k-pop, specifically DAY6. I want to get into games more, I’m not too sure which though (I do like watching people play). I also have been watching a lot of anime and k-drama lately instead of doing my work so....

### What to expect from me

I hope to have a relationship where we can bug each other at who knows what time of day and talk about the most random things. I don’t want to be a mentor, but also someone that my mentee can trust and feel comfortable about the current situation and transitioning into Drexel.
