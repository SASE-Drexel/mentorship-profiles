### About

I would say part of being me is by looking at memes for 50% of the day.  

### Previous Work Experience
- Naval Sea Systems Command

### Career Goals

My ultimate goal is to become a nurse in a hospital and maybe work in the post-anesthesia care unit. I'm trying to live a rewarding life helping people.

### Interests

I play a lot of PC games and watch anime. I'm always on discord. I'm really into watching cooking videos and I also like looking at new technology unveils and reviews.

### What to expect from me

Hopping on discord and playing video games, going out to eat good food, maybe burning a kitchen down trying to cook something, and also trying to improve.
