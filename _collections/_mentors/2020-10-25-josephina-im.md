### About

I get hyper really easily, but get tired just as fast. Spontaneous plans are fun and I will push off schoolwork for memories. uhhhh i am awful with directions and most logical things like that but i try my best. oh and i get scared easily

### Career Goals

My career goals is to find something that would be active and social that I can be passionate about. The specifics of where I end up doesn't really matter, and I have no exact thoughts on it either. 

### Interests

i like late night karaoke with friends and eating good food and dancing for fun and cooking and painting and trying new things and grocery shopping

### What to expect from me

Taking up a mentor role is admittedly kinda burdensome for me so I would like to take it on as more of a friendship. That being said, I will make sure to take care of my mentee and bring them out to hang outs and opportunities!! I want to help my mentee feel more at home or uh more at college? I hope they can feel comfortable enough to reach out to me whenever and me to them.
