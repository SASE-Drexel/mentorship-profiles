### About

I’m a warm and inviting guy once you get past my shy shell. When I’m not overthinking everything and fretting about my workload, I’m an open-minded and friendly person (I swear I don’t bite!). Find me on long-distance runs but also in blankets streaming K-dramas (tissues at the ready). 

### Career Goals

My ultimate goal is to create or make a contribution to a piece of technology that can bring communities together. I would like to land a co-op or internship where I can apply my software skills to hardware in order to create a physical product.

### Interests

I enjoy socializing with friends (especially over food/drinks) and giving back to the community through service and acts of kindness. I also like to cooking/baking; green bean casserole and baked mac and cheese just to name a couple. Send me some recipes and I’ll give them my best shot!

### What to expect from me

I envision that I will have a pretty social relationship with my mentee. I plan to stay in close contact with them, providing an outlet to share whatever is on their mind. If possible, I would love to meet up in person and chat over bubble tea!
