### About

Hi hi! My name is Jessica and I constantly make too much food. Introverted, first generation college student figuring things out. Always available if you need someone to rant to or just need to talk through things. 

### Previous Work Experience
- Vanguard - Developer

### Career Goals

At the end of the day, I want to put some good into the world. I plan to build up my technology background through larger companies through college (and some years after) and use it down the line to help nonprofits further their mission. 

### Interests

I like volunteering, cooking, baking, using construction tools, planning and getting dragged into things. Those are the things that are consistent. I often switch in and out of hobbies so I'm down to try most things (no heights please).

### What to expect from me

I hope that I have a really good relationship with my mentee that they always feel comfortable reaching to me for anything serious or just to talk. They would know that Iâ€™m always there to help. It would great for us to be able to share experiences and try new things together.
