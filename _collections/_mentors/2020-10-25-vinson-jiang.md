### About

I’m a really chill person once you get to know me. I like to enjoy my hobbies while also trying to make sure I stay on top of things in school and other responsibilities. I like making jokes/memes and having a good laugh about everything.

### Previous Work Experience
- Website Manager - Mama May I Shop

### Career Goals

I would like to work for some big tech company under Information Security or Software Development. 

### Interests

Video games (Valorant, League, TFT, Smash) Any game you can think of, I have played or currently play. I play tennis, volleyball and sometimes squash. I'm a computer enthusiast so if anyone wants to build a PC, lmk! I'm a big fan of K-pop and Hip Hop/Rap. I also enjoy travelling, eating food, and exploring new places.

### What to expect from me

I hope that the relationship between my mentee and I will be very well as not only do I want to be a mentor but also a friend and someone that my mentee can talk to whenever he/she has a problem.
