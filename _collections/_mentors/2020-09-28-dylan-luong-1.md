I am someone who continuously looks for new avenues towards self-improvement. I may appear to be really shy at first, but once you get to know me, I naturally start to show my more fun, carefree side. I am ambitious, reliable, and a little silly here and there.

### Career Goals

I want to work in business (not really sure exactly what yet). One of my biggest career goals is to find a job that incorporates my passions and hopefully pays well too.

### Interests

Basketball, videography, photography, writing, video games, board games, martial arts, music, table tennis, watching television, youtube, weight training, squash, biking. I am very much open to trying anything.
