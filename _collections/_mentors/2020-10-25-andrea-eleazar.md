### About

Adventurous and studious introvert who enjoys learning, meeting new people, and organization. Very passionate about music (violin for 13 years). I’m a foodie and love getting food/boba with friends! Avid hot leaf juice drinker; my personality is probably best described as a mix of Iroh and Zuko (ATLA).

### Career Goals

Epidemiologist or biostatistician for the government (CDC/NIH/FDA) or in a global capacity (WHO), but also exploring other fields/industries for R&D like pharmaceuticals and medical technology. I hope to intertwine biomedical science, social science and data analysis to solve medical problems and minimize health disparities.

### Interests

Violin/orchestra; anime, kdramas; Nintendo games (especially Zelda and Fire Emblem); creative writing; food; stationery; badminton. Music genres include kpop, jrock, lofi, (k)r&b, classical, Ghibli music, video game OSTs. 

### What to expect from me

As a mentor and mentee, I hope that our relationship will be productive where both of us will mutually benefit from giving/receiving advice. I hope that I’ll be able to provide overall comfort and guidance for my mentee, and anticipate that having a mentee will provide me with similar comfort. More importantly, I hope that my relationship with my mentee will become a genuine friendship where we are able to be comfortable with each other and talk regularly. Hopefully whenever in-person activities resume, we can go out for some food or exploring together.
