### About

I'm a pretty quiet person when you first get to meet me, but eventually I definitely open up :). I balance my life currently between school (cs grind ðŸ¤¯), going to the gym (can guide u !!), and among us. Also LOVE Kbbq, boba, and sushi. 

### Career Goals

I really see a huge future in system or machine automation so I'd want to involve myself in that type of industry after I graduate. Also something that I'm looking at for my concentration. 

### Interests

I listen to all TYPES of music (edm, kpop, rap, cpop, indie pop), but am really into edm at the moment. Been playing hella among us cause of quarantine and also really enjoy going the gym.

### What to expect from me

I would definitely be down for a combo of all 3, since I think that's a pretty good balance. But it also really depends on the different vibes that we get!
