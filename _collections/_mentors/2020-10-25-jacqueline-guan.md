### About

Hi, I'm Jackie Guan! Many people think that I'm intimidating when they first meet me (or at least that my stare is intense?), but there is NOTHING to be scared of. I'm currently the SASE Jr. Director for our chapter, but I am also the Co-Marketing Chair for ASA and the Marketing Committee Lead for SASE's Northeast Regional Conference!

### Career Goals

That is a great question. To be honest, I am still trying to figure that one out myself! As of right now, I am just trying to pursue my passions and further my skills! I have a lot of interests and I love learning new things, so we shall see where life take me!

### Interests

I really like art! I love a good paint/art night to just chill and relax. I'm also super into hiking and anything outdoorsy, if you ever wanted to get away for the weekend! I am also a huge fan of a good board game (plz play board games with me). I can also play tennis and swim!

### Looking For

I want us to vibe and be comfortable with each other! Just be ready to have a good time.
