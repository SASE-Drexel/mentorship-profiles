### About

I am fun to be around and I love having discussions, whether it'd be pizza toppings to figuring out the circumference of a pizza. I am an energetic person and motivated all the time, even when it's raining, I can put a smile on someone's face.

### Career Goals

I plan on working in an archeological field. That would mean I would travel around the world doing excavation work of historical objects or landmarks. Combining two of my favorite things, traveling, and history, I think it would work out just fine.

### Interests

I like to dance to BTS, do martial arts, play Minecraft, and sleep.

### What to expect from me

I would hope that we would get along very well. I also hope that my mentee see me as a family and close friend rather than someone who is there to mentor for the time being, just like how I view my mentors.
