### About

I am Shirin and a lot of people are scared of me after an initial meeting, but once you get to know me I hope you enjoy my company. I feel like if you either stalk my social media pages or ask other people it will tell you more than what I wrote here.

### Career Goals

I like compartmentalizing things, so basically having individual times for work and individualizing times for hobbies. I see myself having a 9-5 day job that would maybe be unfulfilling, but will fund my travels, photography endeavors, and other hobbies. After work time I want to be able to have fun, spontaneous projects, and potentially work on a home renovation as I do like taking apart floors and tearing down walls.

### Interests

My interests are fairly scattered when I have the time to indulge in them. At the base level, I enjoy photography, video editing, and listening to music. On sunny days I like to take my cruiser board and listen to music while skating through center city. On rainy days I like watching random shows while crocheting, which is how I finished avatar, while also crocheting a whale. 

### What to expect from me

You know when you see a tiktok and you find it funny so you send it to your friend even if they don't laugh? Yeah I want our relationship to be like that with my mentee.
