### About

I am of Chinese-Cambodian descent born in Delaware county! I grew up in a Catholic middle school and went to Central High School in Philly (277). Facts about me: I have a cat named Walle and I love to make people laugh (it can be laughing at me too)!

### Previous Work Experience
- Fire Department IT
- Ehmke Manufacturing Engineer

### Career Goals

Once I graduate, I hope to be working with a company that allows me to work with a team to design and manufacture products that benefit society in some way!

### Interests

My interests include playing video games and watching stuff on my laptop while vibin on my couch (anime, movies, or YouTube). I'm very much into Kpop. I also like to eat out and sleep a lot! During the spring/summer time, I love to go hiking and traveling with friends. 

### What to expect from me

I hope that my mentee will be able to see me as a friend that they can lean on and an advice giver for whatever they need!  Spending time with them and getting to know them personally is a goal of mine!
