### About

I'm a pretty chill and casual person who likes to spend time learning stuff and trying new things. Typically, I'm a very social person, but I'm still an introvert at heart. Always down to experience new stuff and be a little adventurous! 

### Previous Work Experience
- Phoodie, INC. (Full-Stack Developer)
- Susquehanna International Group (Network Security Co-op)

### Career Goals

Though I'm on the path to work in software development or web/app development, I want to try exploring other potential career paths around content creation or free-lancing (coding or content creation).

### Interests

I'm into a variety of different things, but here are some of the bigger ones: video games, dancing, reading, cooking, photography/film, inline skating/ice skating, longboarding

### What to expect from me

I envision my relationship with my mentee as a casual friendship, where we can learn from each other and grow together, but also being able to just talk about everyday stuff, etc.
