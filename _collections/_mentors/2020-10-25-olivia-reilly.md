### About

I take school and work seriously but still want to enjoy life and my interests. I’m more reserved at first but very open once I get to know you. Doing fun activities is always exciting but sometimes just chilling is the way to go. 

### Career Goals

I want to make some decent money while still enjoying my job. Work/life balance is very important to me. 

### Interests

Interests/hobbies: anime/manga, crafts (crochet/knitting/needle felt), chocolate, skiing, piano
Student orgs: ASA, SASE, ASME, GCC, RASC-AL, SWE

### What to expect from me

I want to be able to talk to them (advice/life), have fun with them (perhaps game nights with others/watching anime), or just chill with them and share my awesome music taste.
