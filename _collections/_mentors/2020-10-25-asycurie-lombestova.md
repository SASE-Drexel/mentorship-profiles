### About

I am a big-time weeb (it’s an addiction). My mbti is also between INFP/ENFP (depending on how outgoing I feel that day LOL). I also really like meeting new people.

### Career Goals

I’m looking to become a Physician’s Assistant or healthcare consulting.

### Interests

I like watching anime/reading manga! I don’t really game but I watch a lot of gaming videos on youtube LOL. I’m also really into fashion/styling outfits.

### What to expect from me

I want our relationship to be more of a friendship than the mentor/mentee title. I feel that it would allow us to become closer as people and more comfortable with each other.
