### Career Goals

I'm doing the bs/ms program to get both my master's and bachelor's. I want to explore different industries and leverage my skills to find where I can really cultivate passion in. I think a company where I can grow, contribute towards a positive impact, and have really good financial stability.

### Interests

I love playing tennis, badminton, ping pong, ultimate, paddleboarding, rockclimbing - the list goes on so I just like doing anything athletic. I like crafting like embroidering, sewing plushies, etc. I want to try new things like boxing, kickboxing, and camping. I want to travel the world and visit all the hiking spots and try all the streetfood.
