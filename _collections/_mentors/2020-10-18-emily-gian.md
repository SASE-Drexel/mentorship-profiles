### About

I'm driven and hardworking when it comes to academics and career wise. I have a lotta hobbies, ranging from crafting, gaming, to sports. Passionate about community service, helping others, and building up our SASE community. 

### Career Goals

I'm doing the bs/ms program to get both my master's and bachelor's. I want to explore different industries and leverage my skills to find where I can really cultivate passion in. I think a company where I can grow, contribute towards a positive impact, and have really good financial stability.

### Interests

I love playing tennis, badminton, ping pong, ultimate, paddleboarding, rockclimbing - the list goes on so I just like doing anything athletic. I like crafting like embroidering, sewing plushies, etc. I want to try new things like boxing, kickboxing, and camping. I want to travel the world and visit all the hiking spots and try all the streetfood.

### Looking For

It'll be chill and fun. I hope to build a strong bond with them and try out new things.
