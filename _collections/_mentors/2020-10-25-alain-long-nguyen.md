### About

If you ever wonder what gunk lies in your belly button, then you are friends with me. I close out of Instagram just to open it again. To be honest, the morning pee after waking hits the most. 

### Career Goals

Make enough money so that I have enough to live for myself, my partner-in-life, and my future family. As soon as that is over, I will devote myself to community organizing for Vietnamese people in America.

### Previous Work Experience
- Electric Operations Analyst - PECO, An Exelon Company
- Machine Shop Scheduler- Troemner, LLC

### Interests

Spending hours to make spotify playlist that I don't even listen too, Thrifting, Teamfight tactics xD, sitting on the floor and staring at scenery for 15 min, blinking.  watch street food videos when I eat food.

### What to expect from me

my relationship with my mentee would be like a socks, yeah they're not the same but it does what it's supposed to
