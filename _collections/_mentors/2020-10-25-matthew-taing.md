### About

I'm a pre-junior studying Computer Science, who enjoys video games, board games, volleyball, basketball, anime, boba, and late-night walks. Over quarantine, I've gotten more into stocks, investments, and way too much Among Us. 

### Previous Work Experience
- Stealth Software Developer Coop - Unisys 
- Fullstack Developer Coop - Vanguard

### Career Goals

Software Developer in a big tech city. Hopefully, making a steady passive income in order to become financially independent and retire early.

### Interests

I like video games, board games, volleyball, basketball, anime, boba, and late-night walks as well as food adventures, traveling, and road-trips.

### What to expect from me

A relationship where we're both equals and can learn from each other. I hope that we can hang out, gaming, or finding new food spots when quarantine is over.
