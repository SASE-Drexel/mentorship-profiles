  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Myers Briggs: ISFJ. I‚Äôm pretty introverted (grew up with a speech impediment), but if I‚Äôm with people I‚Äôm comfortable with I can be super energetic and talkative. I‚Äôm a perfectionist, and so even though I procrastinate, I still try hard at everything I do. I‚Äôd consider myself smart and mature, and when my friends are having crises I‚Äôm usually the one that steps in and calms them down.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm still not sure what exactly I want to do, but I want a stable job with a decent salary and am an introvert, so I‚Äôm trying out Data Science/CS stuff for now. Based on my experience working as a gymnastics coach, I think I‚Äôd enjoy a job as a teacher/professor/coach/tutor, but none of those pay very well so‚Ä¶</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I did gymnastics and played violin for 10 years each. I work out regularly and like going for walks outdoors and climbing trees. I‚Äôm into games of all kinds (Egyptian Rat Screw, Hearthstone, Shadowverse, League, Smash Bros, Among Us, Genshin Impact etc.). I read a lot of manga and watch anime (https://myanimelist.net/animelist/starlight4972). I love food in general, and will try almost any food I get a chance to eat.</p>

<h3 id="looking-for">Looking For</h3>

<p>Ideally, I‚Äôd like to have a mentor with the same major who could give me advice about the specific classes/professors I should look out for and could help me with Data Science work. However, I realize that‚Äôs unlikely simply due to how few Data Science majors there are at Drexel. In general though, I‚Äôd like to have a mentor that shares a few interests with me, and who in general I could just have a fun time with. Being able to help with school/co-op stuff would be really nice, but not required.</p>
