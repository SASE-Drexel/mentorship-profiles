  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm a people person. I love meeting new people and learning about their backgrounds, which makes me conversational. I‚Äôm also very energetic and I‚Äôm not afraid to be myself around others. I would also describe myself to be hard working as I strive to do my best in achieving goals I set for myself and I try to help others achieve theirs as well.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>My short-term career goals include being able to intern or volunteer at a doctor‚Äôs office, hospital, or any place in the medical field in order to gain more experience. In the end, I hope to become a physician assistant. I‚Äôd like to work in a hospital and be exposed to a variety of areas in medicine in order to see what field I would specialize in.</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>My main interests include dancing, listening to music, and exploring different restaurants in the city! I listen to all types of music, specifically artists such as keshi, Giveon, BTS, and more. I‚Äôm also obsessed with the shows Avatar and Black Mirror, going out to get kbbq/boba, playing among us (but who isn‚Äôt haha), and traveling/exploring new places.</p>

<h3 id="looking-for">Looking For</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm looking for a mentor who I can easily be comfortable with and be myself around. Not only would I like to look up to them as someone who can guide and help me with advice/connections, but I‚Äôd also like to look to them as a friend/sibling that I have a close bond with.</p>
