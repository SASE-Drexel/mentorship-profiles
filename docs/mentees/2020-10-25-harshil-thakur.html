  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>My name is Harshil Thakur and I am a freshman at Drexel. I am originally from India but have been staying in America for a couple of years. My hobbies are playing guitar, writing poems, hiking, and biking. I am very introverted and take my time to getting to know everyone around me but I do gradually open up. I am very friendly and would love to make new friends and get to know others!</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I am still deciding what to do regarding my career. I know it will be in the field of computers and technology but I need more exposure in order to decide what specifically I want to do in terms of career. I am also interested in entrepreneurship.</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I like to do poetry. It could be about anything that comes to my mind. 
I also like to play my guitar although it has been a few weeks since I touched it. So, I need to start playing again. 
I like to do long-distance biking. So far I was able to go up to 20 miles. 
I love hiking and finding some fun and interesting trails near me.</p>

<h3 id="looking-for">Looking For</h3>

<p>I would like the mentor to be friendly, reachable, encouraging, patient, and give direct and honest feedback.</p>
