          <p class="card-text">Hello, my name is Viwing Zheng. You can just refer to me as Vi. I am a third year studying Computer Science, and I am currently the President of SASE Drexel. My favorite animal is the panda, and a fun fact is that I can say "Imagine pandas eating cherry tomatoes" in at least 5 different languages. I am a very friendly person, and I hope to become very good friends with my mentee. On my free time, I enjoy eating, cooking (I can cook for you!), playing the ukulele, and many more. My hobbies tend to change over time because I like to try out new things! We can try new things together!</p>

My friends describe me as caring and mellow except for when I'm ranting about random stuff; then I'm hotheaded.</p>
