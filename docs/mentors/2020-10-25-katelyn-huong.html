  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Even though I‚Äôm basically 20 years old, I still act like a kid. I love meeting new people and can pretty chill. I do like to stay in and just watch anime for a couple of hours with a box of frosted flakes too. I love to learn, whether it‚Äôs a game or how to tie a shoe, I‚Äôll definitely be interested.</p>

<h3 id="previous-work-experience">Previous Work Experience</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Terumo Medical Corporation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>Still in the air with a couple of things, but I do want to work for a bigger known corporation, maybe in medical devices. I can‚Äôt say that I have a specific career goal in mind, but I hope to be able to work as hard as possible to be in a place and be proud of how far I‚Äôve come.</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I love to bullet journal and play tetris. I‚Äôm also interested in anime and drawing. I‚Äôm interested in making memories with my friends and exploring new places, whether it‚Äôs a new or old location. Boba is definitely a favorite, even though my favorite flavor is milk tea. I like j-pop and k-pop, specifically DAY6. I want to get into games more, I‚Äôm not too sure which though (I do like watching people play). I also have been watching a lot of anime and k-drama lately instead of doing my work so‚Ä¶.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to expect from me</h3>

<p>I hope to have a relationship where we can bug each other at who knows what time of day and talk about the most random things. I don‚Äôt want to be a mentor, but also someone that my mentee can trust and feel comfortable about the current situation and transitioning into Drexel.</p>
